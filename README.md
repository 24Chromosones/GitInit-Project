On our website, you can view and send anonymous kind messages to others around the world! This is a simple yet powerful website that grows in usefulness as more people use it, and we want to help people give the gift of kindness: just a few words can make someone’s day.

## How we came up with the idea:

Well we thought that it was necessary to spread kindness towards our internet community. The internet often has a negative connotation when it comes to the damaging side effects of social media and the ever-increasing cyberbullying occurrences. With this in mind, we thought about creating a platform in which people could anonymously spread kindness and love to other internet users, which ultimately led us to the creation of KindSound!

## Our Mission:

Sometimes, all it takes is a kind word to make someone’s day. We wanted to provide a moment of peace for those who are struggling mentally and emotionally and let them know that even strangers in a wide, wide world do care
